## Building from sources

**Building notes**
* Since v0.4.7 Seabass for Ubuntu Touch is built with patched Cordova from [this repo](https://github.com/milikhin/cordova-ubuntu)
* Since v0.4.8 Seabass for Ubuntu Touch is built with patched Cordova plugins:  
   * [cordova-plugin-file](https://github.com/milikhin/cordova-plugin-file)
   * [cordova-plugin-dialogs](https://github.com/milikhin/cordova-plugin-dialogs)
* It seems that latest Ubuntu Xenial Desktop versions are not supported by Cordova-cli and so original 16.04 image (OR [17.04](https://wiki.ubports.com/wiki/Set-up-Cordova-development-environment-in-a-container)) is required to build Seabass (at least 16.04.2 is not supported due to problems with *click* package)

Updated automatic build script is available at [seabass-build](https://github.com/milikhin/seabass-build) repo.
Manual [build instructions](building.md) are also available.
